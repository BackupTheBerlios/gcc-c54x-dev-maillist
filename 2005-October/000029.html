<PRE>Hello everyone,

This &quot;morning&quot;, we had another of our weekly meetings. Adam (may1937) and I
were the two attendees. We talked about cgen a little, but there is little
to actually report. :)

Both Adam and I can only spend a few hours a week on the project. We are
still reading the cgen docs, and I don't think either of us will have more
to say until we know more about it.

I'll announce the time/date of the next meeting in a day or so. I'd really
enjoy it if more people were able to attend, because two people.. well,
it's not much of a 'meeting'. :) It doesn't matter if you don't have time
to contribute, or know less about cgen or the c54x or gcc than we do (a
difficult feat, to be sure) -- having more people to talk to and bounce
ideas off of would be great.

Ok, see you all later.

-Bryan
