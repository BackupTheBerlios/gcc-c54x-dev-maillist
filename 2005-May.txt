what is the status of this project? dead? active?
how does the resultant code from gnu-gcc-c54x compare with ti's ccs 
tools?
what about support for c55x?

regards,
jeff mathews

Active. :) Most the discussion is happening on #gcc-c54x on Freenode. Right now,
darthgnu (Jonathan) is doing most of the coding, as the rest of us are busy with
school or work.

Right now, we can hardly generate assembly. The project is still in its infancy.

> what about support for c55x?

As mentioned above, we can hardly generate assembly for one member of the c54x
family, let alone c55x. :) The first member of the family we are shooting for is
the 'C5416.

The code can be obtained from the BerliOS svn repository. If you are interested
in contributing, let me know. 

Thanks,

-Bryan

Hi,

Heres my first post in sometime. I have been interested in 
looking at this port for sometime but was too caught up in 
other stuff .

  Hence spent a little while today digging into the status 
with c54x.

As I see it :

binutils appears to support the c54x but the testsuite is 
rather empty . So I am not sure about how broken it is or 
what are the exact instructions that are supported. The 
disassembly files used for comparison are close to empty.

Also I was wondering regarding newlib as discussed on irc. 
newlib is a small library which is typically used for 
embedded development. Getting a newlib port up should be 
pretty straightforward.

GCC: I wanted to spin a build today , but being a convicted 
cvs user could not get around to doing an anonymous checkout 
using svn.

I tried this:

ramana at arnor:/mnt/tools/fsf/fsfgcc/c54xport/berliosrepos$ 
svn checkout svn://svn.berlios.de/gcc-c54x/trunk
svn: URL 'svn://svn.berlios.de/gcc-c54x/trunk' doesn't exist

Then I tried this :
ramana at arnor:/mnt/tools/fsf/fsfgcc/c54xport/berliosrepos$ 
svn checkout 
svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/gcc-c54x/trunk
anamar at svn.berlios.de's password:
svn: URL 
'svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/gcc-c54x/trunk' 
doesn't exist


Is there anything I am doing wrong ?


cheers
Ramana

I feared that might be the case.

I'm no svn expert, and you are obviously doing what they tell you to do on the
project website, but to be honest that doesn't look right. I don't remember
there being a 'trunk'. Testing... Yes, that is right. 

So, in either command, take off "/trunk", e.g.
    export SVN_SSH="ssh -l <yourname>"
    svn checkout svn+ssh://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/gcc-c54x


I wonder why the instructions have changed, and are wrong...

I tried everything but remove the trunk .

Yeah maybe you need to correct the site. Will give this a shot sometime
tomorrow. Time to hit the sack .

The instructions represent a "standard" svn repository, I have moved
files around to reflect that. The berlios instructions are correct and
should work now.

Hi,
This project is pretty much active, we are doing the best we can to get
something together. If you want, look into our svn repository on
gcc-c54x.berlios.de . Right now, the compiler _can_ generate _some_
correct assembly code for 3-line programs, it even assembles and links,
but it crashes on complicated programs (right now, it can't handle a
"if"). One thing we are missing is experience with GCC, we hope some GCC
guru will join in at some point to help polish the port. If we do not
get this help, we can learn, but it will take a lot longer. A good part
of the discussion goes on IRC at #gcc-c54x on freenode.

Feel free to contribute,
Jonathan
