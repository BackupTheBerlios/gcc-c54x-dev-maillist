It should work this time; Apparently list admins don't get messages, so I had to
add myself manually. :)

Hey everyone,

I've been looking into the legal issues surrounding administering a project that
would eventually be integrated into a GNU project. Basically, they are a pain in
the butt. To contribute anything significant to GCC, one has to sign over their
copyright to the FSF. That means that for this project to be accepted into GCC,
either you would all have to sign copy rights to me (and I would later sign mine
over to the FSF), or all of us would have to sign them to the FSF before
contributing.

Another issue is that I'm not even sure it's best to have a separate project. To
be honest, the idea occurred to me only because the two projects I'm familiar
with (cris and the stagnant SF tic54x) both started out as separate from GCC.
Really, though, there is no reason we can't just work on GCC, itself. We have to
deal with copyright papers, anyway, and if we joined the project would be more
visible and in the company of many more experts. 

Therefore, in spite of the work I've put in to BerliOS in the last week, I
propose we abandon it and just hack on GCC proper. We have each other's
addresses, we can still hang out in our own IRC channel, and we can all
subscribe to gcc at gcc.gnu.org, so we'll be in touch. The truth is I just can't
justify having a separate project. 

Besides, it'll be fun to be part of that amazing group of hackers. :)

-Bryan

I have no problem with that.

I would agree that more people would be able to help us and this way and 
it saves the whole "eventual integration" PITA.
