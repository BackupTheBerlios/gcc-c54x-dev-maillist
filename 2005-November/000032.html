<PRE>Hey guys, 

I don't think I will be contributing code to this project anymore. I
really don't have enough time. What's more, sytems programming isn't even
really my area of interest (I started working on this solely so I could
work on the Neuros's interface, which _is_ one of my interests). Besides, I
haven't been contributing code anyway, so this is mainly a change towards
accurately representing my role in the project. :-P

Also, I might still help out, or at least read docs and offer suggestions.
I might even continue to spruce up the website. However, I am officially
declaring that I Am Not Promising Anything. ;) Also, I would like to give 
up the role of 'Project Lead'. Even though it's mostly ceremonial, I think
it would be better suited to someone else. 

Anyways, best of luck to you all. I'll still hang out in #gcc-c54x, so I'll
see you around.

-Bryan
