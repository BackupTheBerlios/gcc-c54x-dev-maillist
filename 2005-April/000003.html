&gt;<i>Hey everyone,

</I>&gt;<i>I've been looking into the legal issues surrounding administering a project that
</I>&gt;<i>would eventually be integrated into a GNU project. Basically, they are a pain in
</I>&gt;<i>the butt. To contribute anything significant to GCC, one has to sign over their
</I>&gt;<i>copyright to the FSF. That means that for this project to be accepted into GCC,
</I>&gt;<i>either you would all have to sign copy rights to me (and I would later sign mine
</I>&gt;<i>over to the FSF), or all of us would have to sign them to the FSF before
</I>&gt;<i>contributing.
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I have no problem with that.

&gt;<i>Another issue is that I'm not even sure it's best to have a separate project. To
</I>&gt;<i>be honest, the idea occurred to me only because the two projects I'm familiar
</I>&gt;<i>with (cris and the stagnant SF tic54x) both started out as separate from GCC.
</I>&gt;<i>Really, though, there is no reason we can't just work on GCC, itself. We have to
</I>&gt;<i>deal with copyright papers, anyway, and if we joined the project would be more
</I>&gt;<i>visible and in the company of many more experts. 
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>I would agree that more people would be able to help us and this way and 
it saves the whole &quot;eventual integration&quot; PITA.

&gt;<i>Therefore, in spite of the work I've put in to BerliOS in the last week, I
</I>&gt;<i>propose we abandon it and just hack on GCC proper. We have each other's
</I>&gt;<i>addresses, we can still hang out in our own IRC channel, and we can all
</I>&gt;<i>subscribe to <A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/gcc-c54x-dev">gcc at gcc.gnu.org</A>, so we'll be in touch. The truth is I just can't
</I>&gt;<i>justify having a separate project. 
</I>&gt;<i>Besides, it'll be fun to be part of that amazing group of hackers. :)
</I>&gt;<i>  
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>Absolutely, looking forward to it myself.
