Message-ID: <20050616030900.GA2736@frodo-the-cat>

Hi everyone, I just wanted to let you know I'm not dead. :) School was very busy
as I finished up, but I am done now, and although I have a Real Job working 40
hours a week, I should actually have more organized free time, and I hope to
continue contributing to this project.

In the two months that I have more or less done nothing, I lost track of our
current status. I am going to write a progress report by tomorrow, and although
I am obviously going to read through the code to get a feel for our position, if
anyone (especially you, Jonathan) has something you think I should add to the
report, please let me know.

I must have the report done by tomorrow at 12 noon, Pacific time. :) Hopefully
this isn't too late to write.

Thank you very much,

-Bryan

I have added my reports to svn. The new one, of course, is the spring quarter
one. Let me know what you think of it.

Thanks,

Looking good, you may want to add that Nokia is also helping us out. 
Paul "lethal" Mundt, of Nokia Finland, will send us some development 
units for the Nokia 770 Internet tablet. Also there has been some 
discussion between Joe Born and Scott Robert Ladd (blog: 
http://chaoticcoyote.blogspot.com/ ). Scott has a lot of experience with 
GCC which should bring us up to another milestone for the port. Also, 
Paul has a friend, his name on IRC is "mrbrown", even though I have not 
been able to contact him, Paul told me that he knows a great deal about 
GCC. Nokia will also put some funds aside to help fund the project 
(mostly for TMS320C55x support).

Cheers,
Jonathan

Whats the status with newlib / binutils ? Last time I checked I ran into
a few issues there. Also I could not find any open source simulator yet
for the c54x ? Is there something setup for testing et al . We ought to
start with getting the testsuite up or is there already something set
up. 

I would also like to contribute some free time towards this . Sorry
about not writing earlier, have been really busy with other stuff. 

cheers
Ramana

There is gdspsim. I've had no success with it so far though. The
included test1.asm assembles using c54x-as and links with c54x-ld (I
don't know how to verify that what I get is valid), but gdspsim crashes
when I try to run the resulting executable. No idea which of binutils or
gdspsim (or both?) is at fault.

Honestly ,one of the first things we need to look at is getting a
simulator for this up and running and identify if the problem is with
the sim or binutils / look at the existence of a simulator for this.

Subject: [gcc-c54x-dev] PATCH - Obvious cleanup.
Message-ID: <1119548978.15278.72.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hi, 

Something that I hit while trying to build c54x-coff  with gcc-2.95. The
local apt proxy here is broken for gcc 3.3 and I have an option of
either good ol' 2.95 or 4.0 running on my laptop. 

It just reorders the declaration of tree param  . 

Please apply as obvious. Don't have write permissions yet. 

cheers
Ramana
